# Kolocash

The Kolocash ($KOLO) Smart Contract is designed to establish a sovereign digital currency for Africa and its diaspora, ensuring financial independence and economic integration. Built on the Polygon blockchain, KOLO incorporates mechanisms to manage liquidity, fund development projects, and enhance financial transparency.

The contract defines a total supply of 100 billion KOLOs, which is minted at deployment. It implements a 4% transaction tax, distributed across different purposes:

- 1% is allocated to liquidity, ensuring price stability and reducing volatility on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
- 1% is burned, gradually reducing the token supply to create scarcity and support long-term value.
- 1% is allocated to the impact wallet, which funds microfinance, infrastructure, education, and intra-African trade initiatives.
- 1% is managed through the treasury wallet, supporting ongoing project development.

To ensure decentralized governance, KOLO implements a DAO-controlled fund management system. The contract initially assigns the treasury, liquidity, and impact wallets, but these can only be updated by a designated DAO smart contract. This guarantees that future changes in fund allocation will be decided by the KOLO community rather than a centralized entity.

Transparency is reinforced through event logging, where all key financial actions—including tax distributions and token burns—are recorded on-chain, allowing users to track transactions in real-time. Furthermore, the contract enables the retrieval of wallet balances for auditability.

By combining governance decentralization, transparent taxation, and token burning, KOLOCASH ensures long-term economic stability and community-driven financial control, making it a foundational tool for African economic empowerment.
